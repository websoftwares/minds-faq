# MindsFaq
Sample FAQ Application

[hosted example](http://minds-faq.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

## UX & Design Task
Please create a small tutorial application with three simple questions and answers:
- What is a Minds Token?
- How do I earn Minds Tokens?
- How do I spend Minds Tokens?

You should use the same colour scheme and design patterns as Minds.com and also make use of our
logos (found at https://www.minds.com/brandingâ€‹). 

## Design plan

Used stock *Angular* latest version because also minds.com uses it, re used *stylesheets* and *logo's* from the main site that uses *Material design lite* and *Font awesome*.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
